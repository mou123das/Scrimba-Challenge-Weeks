#### Implemented the stretch goals: 
* Made the implementation in such a way that the other options would only be enabled if and only if the "TO" option has been filled.
* Added a custom clear button, so that the already written message can be erased.
* Added a custom "Want to add a custom message?" button, which enables the respective field.
